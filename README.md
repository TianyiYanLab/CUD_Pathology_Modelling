### Codes

The main analyses were carried out step-by-step using the codes as follows.

1. **Calculate the cocaine use disorder(CUD)-related cortical thickness deviation patterns and conduct network-level statistical analyses**: S1\_Wscore\_calculation.m; S1\_Network\_atrophy\_stats.ipynb;
   
2. **Calculate the spatial correlation between regional cortical atrophy and the mean atrophy of structurally connected neighbours**: S2\_S3\_Region\_to\_neighbour\_atrophy\_association.ipynb; S2\_System\_level\_stats.ipynb;
   
3. **Calculate the spatial correlation between regional cortical atrophy and the weighted mean atrophy of structurally connected neighbours,with weights derived from structural connecome(SC)-masked biological similarity matrices**: S2\_S3\_Region\_to\_neighbour\_atrophy\_association.ipynb;
   
4. **Identify the CUD epicenters with data-driven ranking-based method**: S4\_Epicenter\_ranking\_identification.ipynb;
   
5. **Perform epicenter-transcription analysis**: S5\_AHBA\_analyses.m;
   
6. **Assign PLS1 genes to seven canonical cell classes**: S6\_Cell\_type\_analysis.ipynb;
   
7. **Explore the association between the epicenter likelihood map and the clinical sympotom-response map derived from repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)**: S7\_TMS\_response\_epicenter\_regression.ipynb;
   
8. **Generate the individualized CUD epicenter likelihood map with data-driven ranking-based method**: S8\_Individualized\_epicenter\_identification.ipynb;
   
9. **Explore the multivariate associations between individual epicenters and behaviors**: S9\_PLS\_input\_preparation.m; S9\_Behavioral\_PLS\_analysis.ipynb.
